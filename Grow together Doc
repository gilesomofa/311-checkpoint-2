My app as of now is called Growing Together. The app will be a portal
where prospective clients can: 

1) Identify local community gardens (api build) and 
offer services as a volunteer, thus gaining gardening experience
 and contributing to a gardening community.
 
2) "Garden entities" can request "volunteers" to assist in 
gardening workers, as volunteers. Also these entities may serve as a venue
for different gardening education activities or event spaces. 

3) Clients may offer materials("Materials Providers") such as compostable waste ie; 
a local cafe, brewery,or farm or a lumber yard that may have useable lumber, et al. 

Users(clients) can be more than one "Type of User". For example, a "Volunteer" 
may also have materials to donate("Materials Provider"), or may actually be a 
"Garden Entity" and may want to help another garden as a volunteer. 

This is a preliminary outlook. As we move forward in this program, the
app's functionality may be streamlined to be more simple in order to be an
appropriate challenge for my skill level and time constraints. I do hope to one
day, expand the features and deploy this app as an actual product geared to growing the 
Organic gardening community hear in the Austin Metropolitan area.
